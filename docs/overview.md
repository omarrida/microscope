# Overview

Microscope is an internal Laravel API service that allows you to:

- Explore a curated list of college schools and analyze their associated ad products.
- Manage schools and manage the ad products that they offer and the price-point of each offering. This lets you price products per-school.
- Browse, sort, and filter ad products and view schools that support them.
- Export our partner schools to a spreadsheet.

## API Docs

Microscope's API is documented (with examples) on Postman, so [check them out](https://example.com).

## Setup Guide

> Note that this guide assumes your machine satisfies the requirements for Laravel 5.8 and Valet. If not, you'll need to checkout https://laravel.com/docs/5.8 or email me at omarrida94@gmail.com for help :)
